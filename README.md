## Why Our Aimbot Obliterates the Competition 💥

Instead of brute-forcing memory writes, our loader plants a **virtual ghost module** that mirrors legitimate DLL calls. Signatures shuffle each map, recoil patterns randomize per burst, and packets ride a spoofed timestamp so server-side catchers log clean swings. Bottom line: buttery frame rates, zero red flags, and a kill-feed that looks like talent not tooling. 🔥
